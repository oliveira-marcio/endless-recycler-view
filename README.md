# Android "Endless" RecyclerView
Just a simple implementation of a RecyclerView with infinite scroll in Kotlin

The approach here is load `RecyclerView` with more data when it is scrolled to the last items loaded.

In this app, all data is generated in realtime and stored in memory, but a pratical use should be with large data fetched from an API or database.

#### How to install
Just import project in Android Studio and run it.
